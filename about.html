                <p>
                    Hi. My name is Jessica Shepherd, but you can call me Jess.
                    I'm a front-end (and aspiring full-stack) Web Developer.
                    I've spent the past couple of years working in private
                    aviation, wondering what I wanted to do with the rest of my
                    life. When a friend of mine suggested programming to me, I
                    immediately knew it was the direction I wanted to go, and
                    haven't looked back since. Some of my fondest memories
                    include me, sitting at my clunky desktop computer, using
                    HTML and CSS to customize every part of my MySpace profile.
                    Yet I never realized that I could turn my love of
                    personalized layouts into a career.
                </p>
                <p id="bottom">
                    I am currently enrolled in a program called Bloc, which is
                    preparing me for every aspect of being a web developer. I am
                    learning both front-end and back-end technologies, along
                    with computer science fundamentals such as data structures
                    and algorithms. It is very hands-on, and I've made several
                    projects with technologies such as React and NodeJS. I'm
                    looking to take these skills I've learned and apply them to
                    my first job as a developer.
                </p>
